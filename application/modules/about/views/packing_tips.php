                <ul style="padding-left:10px">
					<li><b>Planning</b>: Plan everything prior, think twice before packing. You should have a plan even for a return trip or any sort of emergency.</li>
					<li><b>Declutter your home</b>: Take a moving inventory and start noting all the things you need to carry with you and get rid of things you don't need either by selling it online or donating it locally.</li> 
					<li><b>Carry all the necessary paperwork</b>: Carry all your important documents like pan card,aadhar card, passport, valuable possessions, and all the other legal documents you require.</li>
					<li><b>Choosing the best and most reliable packers and movers</b>: By contacting Om Packers and Movers, you can eliminate all of the stress associated with moving your stuff to a new location.</li>
					<li>Medicines, cellphone chargers, cups, dishes, kettle, snacks, a pair of clothes, and other necessities should be packed individually.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>SAFETY PACKING TIPS</h3>
				<ul style="padding-left:10px">
					<li><b>Wrap fragile items in bubble wrap</b>: In the case of appliances, many layers of packaging may be required to offer protection against impact, moisture, and static, especially for inter-city moves.</li>
					<li><b>Labeling</b>: When packing, label the boxes room by room so you know what's inside. To avoid damage, label your boxes as "fragile," "linens," and "accessories," and keep electronics and liquids separated.</li>
					<li><b>Use packing tapes</b>: When it comes to holding heavy materials tightly, duct tapes aren't very reliable. As a result, packing tape is recommended since it is dependable and lasts a long time.</li>
					<li><b>Make Use of Packing Materials Available at Home</b>: Buying stuff when you already have resources at home isn't always a good idea. When packing, be resourceful and make the most of what you have. Pack breakables in towels. Keep your clothes on hangers and cover them with a garbage bag and a large rubber band. Transport odd-shaped goods in rubbish cans and laundry baskets.</li>
